# npm Commands

This requires that you've installed Node.JS and NPM.
You need this for the development, but you don't need it
when deploying using Docker.

## npm start

This runs all pending migrations and starts the server.

## npm run build

This "compiles" the application.

## npm run lint:fix

This fixes the causes of lint warnings (where possible).
