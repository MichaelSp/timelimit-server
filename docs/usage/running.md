# Running

There are 3 options for running this application:

Option 1: Build a docker image and use it  
Option 2: Install Node.JS (see [npm-commands](./npm-commands.md))  
Option 3: Use ``timelimit-server-setup.sh`` if there is nothing yet at your system  

After starting it, you can open ``http://server/time`` to test it,
it should show a timestamp
